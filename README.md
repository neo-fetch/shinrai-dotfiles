# shinrai-dotfiles

Dotfiles of initially shinrai, my laptop, continued now on lee, my Desktop because I barely use my laptop anymore. This repo contains my dotfiles and configuration. I worked hard "borrowing" it from other people's blood and sweat and then I decided to pour into it my own. I need a life.

## Configs Included
